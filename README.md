# Profilio2

## Description

Anyone looking through my repository will likely notice that I have Profilio and Profilio2 in it.  My motivation for Profilio2 was the same as that for Profilio.  But the timing is quite a bit different.  I created the Profilio early on when I was just learning to use html and css.  At that time I didn't know react existed.  Other than that, my motivation for Profilio2 is the same as Profilio.  The main difference is that I have better skills now than I had at that time.  Therefore, this page was created using react and vite.  I also believe I was more restrained in the design.  But I'm afraid it doesn't have that much more as far as content is concerned.  There are more links to various of the projects which can also be seen in my github repositories.  But, there is still a bit of filler when it comes to written content.  As I have been building my skills, I haven't stopped to be prepared to list them all out in the "resume" section of this project.  I also have to think quite a bit more "about me" to make that section whole and complete.  Therefore, Profilio2 much like the original Profilio was for the most part a learning experience as it was my first attempt at a react application. 

Again, like in Profilio I have to admit that the "Contact" page currently doesn't work.  If one were to fill out the form and "submit" it will claim that an email was sent, but I currently am unable to accomplish that.  So any alerts to the contrary just hint at all the more I have to learn. You already know by reading this README.md that I have a github account.  I also do have a linkedIn account, but any other references to social media accounts, real or fantastical are also created to exercise my ability to create the links, but do not reflect actual accounts other than the two already mentioned. Here is a cropped screen shot of the site taken from a wide display ![screen shot](/public/screenshot.jpg)

## Installation
This page was [deployed](https://main--celadon-croissant-e22e09.netlify.app/#Portfolio) directly after the work was completed.  In Github, the index.html is at the same level as this README.md file.  If anyone were curious enough to clone and install the site, node.js is required.  All the dependencies are included so after entering the cloned directory, "npm install" and "npm run start" are all that need be typed in the node.js command line.  On doing that the page will pop up in the system's default browser. Otherwise, the above link goes directly to the site.
